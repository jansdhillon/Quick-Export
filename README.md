# Quick Export
This is just a very simply program I am making for myself. I have 1TB free cloud storgae for OneDrive through UBC, however, I've noticed that sometimes the upload speed of OneDrive interrupts my workflow. Most notably, when I quick export .docx to PDF, the files are often unavailable for some time when I would like to have them isntantly. 

To remedy this, while still abcking up my files on OneDrive, I wrote this python script to automatically move my files from the Quick Export folder to my OneDrive folder.
